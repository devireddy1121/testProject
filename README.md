### Spring Boot Application:
This application runs freely onclick Clean, Install and Run.

The application goal is to evaluate the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 is true or false.

The URL for the applcation is : http://localhost:8080/demoTestProject/index.

Sum of all multiples of 3 upto 1000 =

3+6+9+12+…+999 = x

Sum of all multiples of 5 upto 1000 =

5+10+15+…+995 = y

Now both are arithmetic series which we can sum up by the formula given below

S = n(a + l)÷2

Where n is no. of terms

a and l are first and last terms respectively.

We can find x = 166833 and y = 99500.

But in x and y both series we have taken the numbers which are both factors of 3 and 5 like 15 so we define

z=15+30+…+990

Sum of z series is 33165.

Now desired numbers is x+ y- z.

Which is calculated to be 166833+99500–33165

Final answer is 233168.

z is subtracted because the numbers 15,30,.. are common in both x and y series but we have to account them only once.
